# Project
This is the e-commerce project for a coffee shop, developed in ReactJS.

## Specifications
Bootstrap React Js was used for the UI.
Product categories and products are sourced from Firestore.
Category navigation bar is dynamically presented from Firestore.
React Router is used to manage the navigation paths of the application.
When accessing the shopping cart detail, user information is also included with complementary data to finalize the purchase.
The shopping cart is implemented with Context to be used in the CartWidget and CartDetail.
As a result of the purchase, the information is preserved in Firestore and a message is presented with the id of the purchase made, using Sweetalert2.
It is also possible to access the list of purchases made. Since no user authentication was implemented, all generated purchases are displayed, and not those of a particular user.


# Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
